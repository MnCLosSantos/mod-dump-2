## 🚀 Installation

### 1️⃣ Download & Extract

```bash
# Clone from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/mnc-driftscore.git

# OR download ZIP from Releases
```

Place into your resources folder:
```
[server-data]/resources/[custom]/mnc-driftscore/
```

### 2️⃣ Database Setup

The script **automatically creates** the required table on first start:

- `mnc_drift_styles` - Tracks player style preferences

No manual SQL import needed!

### 3️⃣ Add to Server Config

```lua
# server.cfg
ensure oxmysql
ensure mnc-driftscore
```

### 4️⃣ Configure Settings

Edit `config.lua` to customize:

```lua
-- Default settings
Config.DefaultStyle = 1
Config.DriftThresholdAngle = 15.0
Config.MaxDriftAngle = 120.0
Config.SpinOutRotationRate = 3.5
Config.MinDriftSpeed = 5.0
Config.PointsMultiplierBase = 1.0
Config.ComboTimeout = 3500
Config.InactiveResetTime = 15000

-- HUD positions
Config.HUD = {
    combo = { enabled = true, position = { top = "80px", right = "20px" } },
	multiplier = { enabled = true, position = { top = "50px", right = "850px" } },
	score = { enabled = true, position = { top = "100px", right = "850px" } },
}

-- Style examples (add/remove as needed)
Config.Styles = {
    [1]  = { name = "Classic Green",        bg = "rgba(30,30,46,0.5)",      text = "#ffffff", accent = "#4CAF50",  description = "Clean dark theme with green accents" },
    -- ... more styles ...
}

-- Combo configurations
Config.Combos = {
    -- Angle based
    { name = "Mild Drift",       comboType = "angle", condition = function(a) return a > 15 and a <= 30 end,      multiplier = 0.4 },
    -- ... more combos ...
}
```

### 5️⃣ Add Items to QBCore

No items are required for this script, as it's command-based. However, ensure QBCore is properly configured for player data handling.

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

### 🎯 Drift Detection Settings

```lua
Config.DriftThresholdAngle = 15.0  -- Minimum angle to start drifting
Config.MaxDriftAngle = 120.0       -- Angle beyond which it's a spin-out
Config.SpinOutRotationRate = 3.5   -- Rotation speed for spin-out detection
Config.MinDriftSpeed = 5.0         -- Minimum speed in m/s to score points
Config.ComboTimeout = 3500         -- ms without drifting to end chain
Config.InactiveResetTime = 15000   -- ms without activity to reset total score
```

### 📊 HUD Configuration

```lua
Config.HUD.combo = {
    enabled = true, 
    position = { top = "80px", right = "20px" }  -- CSS positions (top, right, bottom, left)
}
```

### 🎨 Adding New Styles

Add to `Config.Styles` table:

```lua
[26] = {
    name = "Custom Style",
    bg = "rgba(0,0,0,0.5)",
    text = "#ffffff",
    accent = "#ff0000",
    description = "Your custom theme"
}
```

### 🔄 Combo System

Each combo has a type, condition function, and multiplier:

```lua
{ 
    name = "Tandem Bonus",     
    comboType = "tandem", 
    condition = function(nearbyDrifters) return nearbyDrifters >= 1 end, 
    multiplier = 1.4 
}
```
