## 🧠 System Mechanics

### Weapon Validation System

**Client-Side Check:**
```lua
-- Checks if weapon is drawn (not holstered)
GetSelectedPedWeapon(playerPed) ~= WEAPON_UNARMED
```

**Server-Side Verification:**
```lua
-- Confirms player actually owns a weapon in inventory
QBCore.Functions.CreateCallback('mnc-robnpc:server:HasWeapon')
```

**Supported Weapon Categories:**
- 🔪 Melee (knives, bats, crowbars, etc.)
- 🔫 Handguns (pistols, revolvers)
- 🔫 SMGs (machine pistols, micro SMGs)
- 🔫 Shotguns (pump, sawed-off, assault)
- 🔫 Assault Rifles (carbines, bullpups)
- 🔫 LMGs (combat MG, Gusenberg)
- 🔫 Sniper Rifles
- 💣 Heavy Weapons (RPG, grenade launcher)
- 💣 Throwables (grenades, Molotovs)

**Complete weapon list in `server.lua` - 80+ weapons supported!**

### Robbery Flow

```
1. Player targets NPC with weapon drawn
   ↓
2. Client validates: drawn weapon + distance
   ↓
3. Server validates: weapon in inventory
   ↓
4. NPC freezes, raises hands, faces player
   ↓
5. Player aims weapon automatically
   ↓
6. Progress bar runs (16s default)
   ↓
7. Success: Cash given, police notified
   OR
   Cancel: NPC released, no reward
   ↓
8. NPC marked as robbed (can't rob again)
```

### Police Notification Flow

```
1. Robbery completes successfully
   ↓
2. Server gets robbery coordinates
   ↓
3. Finds all online players with police job
   ↓
4. Sends notification to each officer
   ↓
5. Officer sees alert with location
   ↓
6. Officer presses [E] within 10 seconds
   ↓
7. GPS waypoint set + blip appears
   ↓
8. Blip disappears after 24 seconds
```

### Anti-Robbery Protections

**NPCs Cannot Be Robbed If:**
- ❌ Already robbed this session
- ❌ In a vehicle
- ❌ Dead
- ❌ Not human (animals, special models)
- ❌ Mission/scripted NPCs
- ❌ Player is too far away (>3m)

**Players Cannot Rob If:**
- ❌ No weapon drawn
- ❌ No weapon in inventory
- ❌ Too far from target

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Rob Pedestrian" option not appearing:**
- Ensure qb-target is running
- Check if NPC is human (not animal/special ped)
- Verify NPC isn't in vehicle
- Confirm NPC hasn't been robbed already
- Try restarting resource: `/restart mnc-robnpc`

**"You need to draw a weapon" error:**
- Actually equip/draw your weapon (not just have it)
- Press weapon key or use weapon wheel
- Verify weapon is visible in your hands
- Try switching to different weapon

**"You need a weapon in inventory" error:**
- Check you actually own a weapon
- Weapon must be in inventory, not just equipped
- Verify weapon item name matches QBCore items
- Check server console for callback errors

**Police not receiving alerts:**
- Verify job name matches `Config.NotifyJobs`
- Check officer is on duty (job.onduty = true may be required)
- Ensure ox_lib is properly installed
- Look for client console errors

**Blip not appearing:**
- Must press [E] within notification duration
- Check `Config.BlipTime` isn't set to 0
- Verify notification shows up first
- Client console may show errors

**NPC stuck with hands up:**
- Restart resource: `/restart mnc-robnpc`
- NPC should unfreeze automatically after robbery
- Check for client errors during cleanup
- Bug may occur if resource stopped mid-robbery

**Progress bar doesn't appear:**
- Ensure ox_lib is running
- Check ox_lib version is current
- Look for client console errors
- Verify resource started after ox_lib

## 🎨 Customization Examples

### Adjusting Difficulty & Rewards

```lua
-- Make robberies faster and more profitable
Config.RobDuration = 8000   -- 8 seconds instead of 16
Config.MinCash = 50         -- $50 minimum
Config.MaxCash = 300        -- $300 maximum

-- Make robberies slower and less rewarding
Config.RobDuration = 30000  -- 30 seconds
Config.MinCash = 5          -- $5 minimum
Config.MaxCash = 50         -- $50 maximum
```

### Adding Multiple Law Enforcement Jobs

```lua
Config.NotifyJobs = {
    "police",
    "bcso",        -- Blaine County Sheriff
    "sheriff",
    "sasp",        -- San Andreas State Police
    "corrections", -- Prison guards
    "rangers"      -- Park rangers
}
```

### Custom Notification Messages

```lua
-- Casual server style
Config.NotifyMessage = "Someone's getting mugged at %s! Get over there!"

-- Serious RP style
Config.NotifyMessage = "10-31 - Armed Robbery in progress at %s. All units respond. Press [E] to mark."

-- Minimal style
Config.NotifyMessage = "Robbery at %s - [E] to respond"
```

### Changing Blip Appearance

```lua
-- Discrete response (green, smaller)
Config.BlipSprite = 161
Config.BlipColour = 2      -- Green
Config.BlipScale = 0.7     -- Smaller
Config.BlipTime = 15       -- 15 seconds only

-- High priority (flashing red, larger)
Config.BlipSprite = 161
Config.BlipColour = 1      -- Red
Config.BlipScale = 1.5     -- Larger
Config.BlipTime = 60       -- 1 minute
```

### Extended Blip Duration

```lua
-- Blip lasts 2 minutes for slow response
Config.BlipTime = 120

-- Blip lasts only 10 seconds (quick dispatch)
Config.BlipTime = 10
```

---

## 🔗 Advanced Modifications

### Adding Item Rewards

Modify `server.lua` in the `GiveCash` event:

```lua
-- Give cash + chance for items
local amount = math.random(Config.MinCash, Config.MaxCash)
Player.Functions.AddMoney('cash', amount)

-- 30% chance to get a phone
if math.random(100) <= 30 then
    Player.Functions.AddItem('phone', 1)
    TriggerClientEvent('inventory:client:ItemBox', src, 
        QBCore.Shared.Items['phone'], "add")
end

-- 10% chance to get jewelry
if math.random(100) <= 10 then
    Player.Functions.AddItem('rolex', 1)
    TriggerClientEvent('inventory:client:ItemBox', src, 
        QBCore.Shared.Items['rolex'], "add")
end
```

### Adding Success Chance

Modify `client.lua` before giving cash:

```lua
if success then
    robbedPeds[ped] = true
    local coords = GetEntityCoords(ped)
    
    -- 85% success chance, 15% NPC fights back
    if math.random(100) <= 85 then
        TriggerServerEvent('mnc-robnpc:server:GiveCash', coords)
    else
        -- NPC fights back
        TaskCombatPed(ped, playerPed, 0, 16)
        lib.notify({
            title = 'Robbery Failed',
            description = 'The pedestrian fought back!',
            type = 'error'
        })
    end
end
```

### Adding Cooldown System

Add to `client.lua`:

```lua
local lastRobbery = 0
local ROBBERY_COOLDOWN = 60000  -- 60 seconds

-- In AttemptRob event, before weapon check:
if GetGameTimer() - lastRobbery < ROBBERY_COOLDOWN then
    local remaining = math.ceil((ROBBERY_COOLDOWN - (GetGameTimer() - lastRobbery)) / 1000)
    lib.notify({
        title = 'Cooldown Active',
        description = 'Wait ' .. remaining .. ' seconds before robbing again.',
        type = 'error'
    })
    return
end

-- After successful robbery:
lastRobbery = GetGameTimer()
```

### Adding Wanted Level

Add to `server.lua` after cash is given:

```lua
-- Give 2-star wanted level
TriggerClientEvent('police:SetCopCount', src, 2)
```

### Blacklisting Specific Weapon Types

Modify `server.lua` weapons table to exclude categories:

```lua
-- Remove throwables if you don't want grenade robberies
-- Just delete or comment out the throwables section:
-- "weapon_grenade", "weapon_bzgas", "weapon_molotov", etc.

-- Or create separate lists:
local validRobberyWeapons = {
    "weapon_pistol",
    "weapon_combatpistol",
    -- Only allow handguns...
}
```
